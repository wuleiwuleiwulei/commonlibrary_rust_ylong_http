//! HTTP asynchronous client module.
//!
//! This module provides asynchronous client components.
//!
//! - [`Client`]: The main part of client, which provides the request sending
//! interface and configuration interface. `Client` sends requests in an
//! asynchronous manner.
//!
//! - [`Connector`]: `Connector`s are used to create new connections
//! asynchronously. This module provides `Connector` trait and a `HttpConnector`
//! which implements the trait.
