//! Error codes are 32-bit fields that are used in `RST_STREAM` and `GOAWAY`
//! frames to convey the reasons for the stream or connection error.
//!
//! Error codes share a common code space. Some error codes apply only to either
//! streams or the entire connection and have no defined semantics in the other
//! context.
