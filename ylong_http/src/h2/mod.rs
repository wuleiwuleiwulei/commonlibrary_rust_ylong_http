//! [Http/2] Protocol Implementation.
//!
//! # Introduction
//! The performance of applications using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol
//! ([HTTP]) is linked to how each version of HTTP uses the underlying
//! transport, and the conditions under which the transport operates.
//!
//! Making multiple concurrent requests can reduce latency and improve
//! application performance. HTTP/1.0 allowed only one request to be outstanding
//! at a time on a given [TCP] connection. [HTTP/1.1] added request pipelining,
//! but this only partially addressed request concurrency and still suffers from
//! application-layer head-of-line blocking. Therefore, HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1
//! clients use multiple connections to a server to make concurrent requests.
//!
//! Furthermore, HTTP fields are often repetitive and verbose, causing
//! unnecessary network traffic as well as causing the initial TCP congestion
//! window to quickly fill. This can result in excessive latency when multiple
//! requests are made on a new TCP connection.
//!
//! HTTP/2 addresses these issues by defining an optimized mapping of HTTP's
//! semantics to an underlying connection. Specifically, it allows interleaving
//! of messages on the same connection and uses an efficient coding for HTTP
//! fields. It also allows prioritization of requests, letting more important
//! requests complete more quickly, further improving performance.
//!
//! The resulting protocol is more friendly to the network because fewer TCP
//! connections can be used in comparison to HTTP/1.x. This means less
//! competition with other flows and longer-lived connections, which in turn
//! lead to better utilization of available network capacity. Note, however,
//! that TCP head-of-line blocking is not addressed by this protocol.
//!
//! Finally, HTTP/2 also enables more efficient processing of messages through
//! use of binary message framing.
